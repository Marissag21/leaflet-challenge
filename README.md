# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge I first store the API endpoint as a queryUrl and the perfrom a GET request to the query URL. I then created a function that created the features for the map. A bindPopup was created that gives us the place, magnitude and date of the earthquake. (I couldn't quite figure out how to do the marker.)

Then a function to create the map was created with the base layers, baseMap objects, the overlay, and in the end creating a layer control.
